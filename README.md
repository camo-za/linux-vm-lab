# 🐧 VirtualBox VM Lab – Ubuntu Linux Administration (22.04 LTS)

This project showcases the setup, configuration, and administration of an **Ubuntu Linux virtual machine**, built and documented using **Oracle VirtualBox**.

It forms part of my **CompTIA A+ certification study**, hands-on technical development, and preparation for an **IT Support / Junior SysAdmin role**.

## 🌿 Project Overview

This lab simulates real-world IT Support and Linux System Administration tasks in a controlled virtual environment.  
It covers:

- Operating system installation (Ubuntu Linux)
- User & group administration
- File system navigation & Linux directory structure
- Package management with **APT**
- File permissions & ownership (chmod, chown)
- Networking basics & commands
- Process management & logs
- Sudo/root privileges
- Troubleshooting & essential CLI tools

All work is fully documented with **screenshots**, organised into clearly structured sections.
